# NeuroGrid Core

NeuroGrid Core is the blockchain and identity backbone for NeuroGrid — the global AI × DeSci system for post-operative care and remote patient monitoring (RPM). This repo contains core smart-contract interfaces, governance outlines, and protocol docs for consent, device registration, and verifiable scientific provenance.

Key focus:
- Consent & data-access contracts
- Device registration and identity
- Reputation & funding primitives for DeSci
- Minimal on-chain footprint (hash + metadata only)
