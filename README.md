# NeuroGrid-Core: Decentralized Intelligence for AI Agents and Scientific Research in Post-Operative Care

NeuroGrid is a hybrid AI x DeSci network designed for autonomous agents, scientific compute, and decentralized knowledge. It integrates AI components (autonomous agents, decentralized compute routing, identity, receipts, inference, distributed workloads) with DeSci elements (research networks, verifiable scientific computation, decentralized biomed data layers, reproducibility receipts, open-data knowledge graph, federation of research agents, human-machine co-labs, bridges to Aethera BioSync) to support post-operative care. Built on BNB Chain for the hackathon, it forms the foundation of the Avatariam Foundation AFK ecosystem, enabling secure, scalable intelligence for recovery and research.

## Features
- **AI Components**: Autonomous agents for task automation, decentralized compute routing for efficient workloads, identity management, receipts for transactions, inference engines for predictions, and distributed processing.
- **DeSci Components**: Research networks for collaboration, verifiable computation for biomedical data, decentralized layers for data sharing, reproducibility receipts, open-data knowledge graphs, federated agents, human-machine co-labs, and bridges to Aethera BioSync.
- **Post-Operative Focus**: Tailored for recovery monitoring, complication prediction, and research-driven care plans.
- **Security**: Encrypted data, audit logs, and ZKP for privacy.
- **Scalability**: P2P networking, cross-chain support, and token incentives.

## Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/avatariamfoundation-afk/neurogrid-core.git`
2. Install: `npm install` (and `pip install requests python-dotenv` for AI)
3. Configure: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in keys.
4. Deploy: `npm run deploy`
5. Start: `npm start`
6. Demo: `npm run demo` and open http://localhost:8080

## Demo
Live demo: [link-to-deployed-demo] (e.g., on BNB Testnet). Test agent routing and research computation.

## API
See `docs/api.md` for endpoints on agents, compute, and research.

## Testing
- API: `npm run test-api`
- Contracts: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Security and Compliance
- AES encryption and ZKPs for data.
- Audit logs for reproducibility.
- Alignment with biomedical standards.

## Future Roadmap
- Full integration with Aethera BioSync.
- Advanced human-machine co-labs.
- Global federation of research agents.
