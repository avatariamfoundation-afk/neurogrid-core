# NeuroGrid — Decentralized AI & DeSci Infrastructure on BNB Chain  
**Built by Aethera BioSync**  
**BNB Hackathon Submission — Smart Builders Challenge**

NeuroGrid is an open-source decentralized intelligence platform built on **BNB Chain**, combining **AI-driven biosignal analysis**, **DeSci collaboration**, and **Web3 smart contracts** for secure research validation and incentive alignment.

The system is designed to demonstrate **real-world scientific infrastructure** while remaining **hackathon-ready**, modular, and extensible toward production deployment.

## Core Pillars

### 🧠 AI (MedIntel)
- Processes biosignal or synthetic biomedical data
- Generates deterministic analysis outputs
- Designed for ethical, explainable inference pipelines
- Outputs are structured for on-chain anchoring

### 🔗 Blockchain (NeuroGrid-Core)
- Immutable artifact registry
- ERC20-based incentive mechanism
- Research contribution tracking
- Access-controlled state transitions
- Deployed and tested via Hardhat (BNB-compatible)

### 🧪 DeSci (Collaboration Layer)
- Open research sharing
- Contribution validation
- Incentive alignment
- Transparent auditability
