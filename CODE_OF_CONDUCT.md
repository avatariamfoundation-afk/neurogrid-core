# NeuroGrid Code of Conduct

## Purpose

NeuroGrid is a decentralized, open-source healthcare and medical intelligence system.
Because this project touches sensitive domains (healthcare, AI, blockchain, and data ethics),
we hold contributors to a high standard of conduct.

This Code of Conduct exists to:
- Protect contributors and users
- Ensure ethical collaboration
- Maintain regulatory credibility
- Signal maturity to auditors, judges, and partners

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All repositories under the NeuroGrid ecosystem
- All contributors, maintainers, reviewers, and observers
- All communication channels (GitHub, issues, pull requests, discussions)

## Core Principles

All participants must adhere to the following principles:

- **Respect** — Treat all contributors with professionalism and dignity
- **Integrity** — No deception, plagiarism, or misrepresentation
- **Security Awareness** — No reckless disclosure of vulnerabilities or sensitive data
- **Medical Responsibility** — No claims that imply clinical use without validation
- **Open Collaboration** — Constructive critique is encouraged; hostility is not

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

- Harassment, abuse, or discriminatory language
- Publishing private, sensitive, or medical data
- Introducing malicious code or backdoors
- Misrepresenting system capabilities (especially medical claims)
- Bypassing security, compliance, or review processes
- Spam, self-promotion, or unrelated commercial activity

## Medical & Regulatory Disclaimer

NeuroGrid is a **research and prototype system**.
It is **not** a certified medical device and must not be presented as such.

Contributors must not:
- Claim regulatory approval where none exists
- Market the system as diagnostic or therapeutic
- Provide medical advice through the platform

## Security & Vulnerability Disclosure

Security issues must be reported **privately**.

Do NOT open public issues for vulnerabilities.

Instead:
- Use the SECURITY.md process
- Allow maintainers reasonable time to respond
- Coordinate disclosure responsibly

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take action including:
- Warning
- Temporary suspension
- Permanent ban
- Rejection of contributions

Enforcement decisions are final and based on project safety, legality, and integrity.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:
- Report it privately via the SECURITY.md channel
- Provide clear evidence where possible

Reports will be handled discreetly and respectfully.

## Acknowledgement

By contributing to NeuroGrid, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.
