# BATCH_ANCHORING_STANDARD.md
**NeuroGrid CORE · DeSci · MedIntel**

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the **mandatory batch anchoring mechanism** for all high-volume, off-chain artifacts submitted to the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objective is to:
- Preserve scalability
- Control on-chain write frequency
- Maintain audit-grade integrity
- Prevent registry saturation

Batch anchoring is **not an optimization**; it is a **hard requirement**.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:

- DeSci research artifacts
- Validation records
- Performance metrics
- Bias analyses
- Model evaluation outputs
- Regulatory evidence bundles

It applies to all environments (test, staging, production).

---

## 3. Normative Principle

> **No individual artifact may be anchored on-chain if it can be safely included in a batch.**

Single-artifact anchoring is allowed **only** for:
- Emergencies
- Critical safety signals
- Governance actions

All routine activity must be batched.

---

## 4. Batch Definition

A **batch** is a cryptographic aggregation of multiple off-chain artifacts represented by a single on-chain anchor.

Each batch MUST contain:
- A Merkle root or equivalent digest
- A deterministic artifact list
- A batch timestamp
- A domain identifier

---

## 5. Mandatory Batch Structure

Each batch MUST be represented off-chain as:

- `batch_id`
- `batch_domain` (DESCI / MEDINTEL)
- `batch_type` (RESEARCH / VALIDATION / PERFORMANCE / BIAS / SAFETY)
- `artifact_count`
- `artifact_hash_list` (ordered)
- `batch_root_hash`
- `generation_timestamp`
- `generated_by`

Only `batch_root_hash` is permitted on-chain.

---

## 6. Anchoring Procedure

### 6.1 Preparation (Off-Chain)

1. Collect eligible artifacts
2. Hash each artifact deterministically
3. Construct ordered hash list
4. Generate Merkle root (or equivalent)
5. Persist full batch manifest off-chain

### 6.2 On-Chain Submission

The following MUST be anchored via `NeuroGridCore`:

- `recordHash = batch_root_hash`
- `domain = batch_domain`
- `recordType = batch_type`
- `emergencyFlag = false` (unless explicitly required)

No raw artifacts or metadata may be submitted.

---

## 7. Batch Size & Frequency Constraints

### 7.1 Size

- Minimum recommended artifacts per batch: **10**
- No maximum size (bounded off-chain)

### 7.2 Frequency

- Routine batches: scheduled (daily / weekly)
- Ad-hoc batching is discouraged
- High-frequency anchoring is prohibited

---

## 8. Emergency Exception

During declared emergencies:

- Single-artifact anchoring is permitted
- Emergency batches may be smaller
- `emergencyFlag` MUST be set to `true`

All emergency anchors must later be reconciled into a post-event batch.

---

## 9. Audit & Verification

Auditors must be able to:

- Recompute batch root independently
- Verify inclusion of any artifact
- Trace batch to on-chain anchor
- Cross-link batch to validation records

Failure to reproduce a batch invalidates the anchor.

---

## 10. Prohibited Practices

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- Anchoring raw artifacts
- Anchoring partial batches
- Anchoring unordered artifact sets
- Re-anchoring identical batches
- Splitting batches to increase on-chain activity

---

## 11. Enforcement

Violation of this standard constitutes:

- Registry write abuse
- Scalability breach
- Governance violation

Sanctions may include:
- Revocation of registry write permissions
- Interface suspension
- Mandatory re-anchoring

---

## 12. Relationship to Other Standards

This standard must be read alongside:

- SCALABILITY_ASSURANCE_ADDENDUM.md
- DESCI_REGISTRY_MECHANICS.md
- DATA_PROVENANCE_AND_LINEAGE.md
- VALIDATION standards
