## 2. High-Level System Overview

NeuroGrid is a **decentralized medical intelligence framework** composed of three coordinated systems:

1. **CORE** — Trust, validation, governance, and blockchain logic  
2. **MEDINTEL** — Medical AI interface and clinician-facing intelligence layer  
3. **DESCI** — Decentralized science registry for traceability and auditability  

These systems are **loosely coupled**, meaning failure in one does not collapse the others.
