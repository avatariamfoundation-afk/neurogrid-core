# NeuroGrid — Final Submission Checklist (HACKATHON LOCK)

This checklist exists to ensure **nothing critical is missing** before final submission.
Every item must be truthfully checked. No assumptions.

If all sections are satisfied, NeuroGrid is submission-ready.

---

## 1. Repository Integrity (ALL REPOS)

Repos:
- core
- medintel
- desci

✔ Repositories are public  
✔ Default branch is clean (no uncommitted work)  
✔ No broken imports or placeholder files  
✔ README.md present and descriptive  
✔ License present (MIT)  
✔ No secrets, keys, or credentials committed  

---

## 2. Documentation Artifacts (MANDATORY)

Located in `core/docs/`:

✔ SECURITY_POSTURE.md  
✔ CONTRIBUTION_FRAMEWORK.md  
✔ SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md  
✔ DEMO_READINESS.md  
✔ JUDGE_DEFENSE_QA.md  
✔ FINAL_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md  

All documents:
✔ Written clearly  
✔ Non-speculative  
✔ Hackathon-appropriate  
✔ No medical claims

## 3. Testnet Deployment Proof (BNB)

✔ Smart contracts deployed to **BNB Testnet**  
✔ Contract addresses recorded (internally or in README)  
✔ No mainnet deployment  
✔ No real funds involved  
✔ Deployment reproducible  

---

## 4. Open-Source Validation

✔ Code is readable and structured  
✔ No proprietary dependencies required  
✔ Build instructions present  
✔ External reviewer can clone and run  
✔ Open-source intent is clear  

---

## 5. Security Posture (Hackathon-Grade)

✔ Static analysis / linting performed  
✔ Obvious vulnerabilities addressed  
✔ Contracts are minimal and non-custodial  
✔ No autonomous medical actions  
✔ Human-in-the-loop enforced by design  

---

## 6. API & Integration Sanity

✔ API surface documented (even if minimal)  
✔ POST vs GET decisions explained  
✔ No hidden endpoints  
✔ Cross-repo boundaries clearly defined  
✔ Failure modes acknowledged  

---

## 7. Demo Readiness (CRITICAL)

✔ Demo scenario defined  
✔ Demo does NOT require live patients  
✔ Demo does NOT require real credentials  
✔ Demo can be explained in under 5 minutes  
✔ Demo shows **why this matters**, not just how  

---

## 8. Judge Risk Mitigation

✔ Medical disclaimer understood and enforced  
✔ “Decision support only” language consistent  
✔ No diagnostic claims  
✔ No regulatory misrepresentation  
✔ No token price / ROI discussion  

---

## 9. Narrative Consistency Check

✔ Same story across:
  - README
  - Demo
  - Q&A
  - Pitch

✔ Core framing is consistent:
  “Trust & validation layer for medical AI”

---

## 10. Final GitHub Release State

✔ Release created for all three repos  
✔ Release notes are concise  
✔ Tagged versions are aligned  
✔ No missing files after tagging  

---

## 11. Final Go / No-Go Declaration

If **ALL** above are checked truthfully:

→ NeuroGrid is **HACKATHON-READY**  
→ Submission risk is **LOW**  
→ Judge defense posture is **STRONG**

If ANY item is unchecked:
→ Fix immediately before submission.

## Final Rule

Do not add features.
Do not refactor.
Do not expand scope.

**Stability beats ambition at submission.**
